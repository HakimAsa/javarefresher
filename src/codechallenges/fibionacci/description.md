Implement Fibionacci number
F0 = 0
F1 = 1
Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2
- The famous Fibonacci numbers problem can be implemented recursively
- The famous Fibonacci numbers problem can be implemented using dynamic programming (for better time complexity)
- The famous Fibonacci numbers problem can be implemented using tabulation technique (for optimal solution)
